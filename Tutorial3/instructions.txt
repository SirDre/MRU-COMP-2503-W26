STEP 1: Place all files in the same directory
----------------------------------------------
Make sure these files are all in ONE directory:
  ✓ Column.java
  ✓ Row.java
  ✓ Tables.java
  ✓ RowTextComparator.java
  ✓ Main.java
  ✓ data.txt  <-- IMPORTANT: This file MUST be here!


STEP 2: Open command prompt/terminal in that directory
-------------------------------------------------------
Navigate to the directory containing all the files above.


STEP 3: Compile the Java files
-------------------------------
Run this command:
    javac *.java

This will create .class files in the same directory.


STEP 4: Run the program
------------------------
Run this command:
    java Main


WHAT TO EXPECT:
---------------
The program will:
1. Read data from data.txt
2. Display the table as read from file
3. Display the table sorted by ID (using Comparable)
4. Display the table sorted by text (using Comparator)
5. Add a new row and display the updated table


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you get "FileNotFoundException: data.txt":
  → Make sure data.txt is in the SAME directory as Main.class
  → Make sure you're running "java Main" FROM that directory
  → The program will show you where it's looking for the file

If you get "ClassNotFoundException":
  → Make sure you compiled first with "javac *.java"
  → Make sure all .java files are in the same directory


DATA FILE FORMAT (data.txt):
-----------------------------
Each line should be in the format: id,text
Example:
1,computer
3,people
2,animals

Do not include a header line in the file.
